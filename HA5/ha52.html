        The <a href="#" style="border:3px dashed green;">CSS</a><strong
        style="border:3px dashed black;">box model</strong> <span
        style="border:3px dashed blue;">is the foundation of layout on the Web
        - each element is represented as a rectangular box</span>, with the
        box`s content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another
        like the layers of an onion. As a browser renders a web page layout, it
        works out what styles are applied to the content of each box, how big
        the surrounding onion layers are, and where the boxes sit in relation
        to one another.
